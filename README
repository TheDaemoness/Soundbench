WARNING: This project has been abandoned. It is potentially usable for simple chiptune music, but will not be receiving updates.

To build Soundbench, the following are required:
        A (mostly) C++11 compliant compiler. The following compilers have been tested and are known to work:
            g++ 4.8.0
            clang++ 3.4
        qmake
        libqt (version 5.0+)
	libsndfile

In addition, the following are strongly recommended:
        One or more of the following:
            RtAudio (version 4+)
            PortAudio (version 19+, deprecated)
        RtMidi (version 2.0+, may not work on OS X)
        JACK Audio Connection Kit (1 or 2, 2 is preferred)

===BUILDING ON *NIX===
All you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:
	cd path/to/the/src
	qmake
	make

Your executable will be in the same directory and will be named "Soundbench". Have fun!

===BUILDING ON WINDOWS===
Instructions on how to build on Windows will be provided soon.

Building, however, shouldn't vary too much from the procedure for building on *NIXes.

If attempting to build on Windows, building without PortAudio is strongly recommended. It's apparently a living hell to set up on Windows.

===OS X NOTES===
Currently, the CPU meter is broken on OS X.

If there are problems compiling libsndfile due to a missing Carbon header in sndfile-play, removing the line:
#include <Carbon.h> 
...from the offending file may fix the problem.

===COMPILE-TIME CONFIGURATION SWITCHES===
Soundbench does have a few qmake variables that allow the user to disable one or more features in exchange for a removed dependency.

noPortAudio
Remove PortAudio.

noRtAudio
Remove RtAudio. This will remove Soundbench's default audio backend.

noJack
Remove JACK. Soundbench may still work with JACK if one of the other APIs is compiled to use it.

noRtMidi
Remove RtMidi. This will remove Soundbench's default MIDI frontend.
