To build Soundbench, you have to make absolutely sure you have the following:
        A (mostly) C++11 compliant compiler. The following compilers have been tested and are known to work:
            g++ 4.7.0
            clang++ 3.2
        qmake
        libqt (version 5.0+)
	libsndfile

In addition, the following are strongly recommended:
        One or more of the following:
            RtAudio (version 4+)
            PortAudio (version 19+)
        RtMidi (version 2.0+)
        JACK Audio Connection Kit (1 or 2, 2 is preferred)

===BUILDING ON *NIX===
All you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake
	make

Your executable will be in the same directory and will be named "Soundbench". Have fun!

===BUILDING ON WINDOWS===
Instructions on how to build on Windows will be provided soon.

If attempting to build on Windows, we recommend doing so without PortAudio as apparently it is rather difficult to compile.


===OS X NOTES===
Currently, the CPU meter is broken on OS X.

If there are problems compiling libsndfile due to a missing Carbon header in sndfile-play, removing the line:
#include <Carbon.h> 
...from the offending file may fix the problem.

===CONFIGURATIONS===
Soundbench does have a few configurations that allow the user to disable one or more features in exchange for a removed dependency.

noPortAudio
Remove PortAudio.

noRtAudio
Remove RtAudio. This will remove Soundbench's default audio backend.

noJack
Remove JACK. Soundbench may still work with JACK if one of the other APIs is compiled to use it.

noRtMidi
Remove RtMidi. This will remove Soundbench's default MIDI frontend.
