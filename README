To build Soundbench, you have to make absolutely sure you have the following:
        A (mostly) C++11 compliant compiler. The following compilers have been tested and are known to work:
            g++ 4.6.3
            clang++ 3.1
        qmake
        libqt 4 or 5
	libsndfile

In addition, the following are strongly recommended:
        One or more of the following:
            RtAudio
            PortAudio (version 19+)

===BUILDING ON *NIX===
All you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake
	make

Your executable will be in the same directory and will be named "Soundbench". Have fun!


===ON BUILDING WITH CLANG===
If you're going to build Soundbench with clang, then as at the time of writing qmake doesn't have a spec file for clang++, you will have to use few extra steps.

In addition to the above prerequisites, we recommend having LLVM's libc++, as clang++ doesn't play too nicely with libstdc++.

If g++ is your defualt C++ compiler, then open a terminal, and type the following
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake

Then open the resulting Makefile in your favorite text-editing program, and do the following:
	Change lines 11, 12, and 17 to use clang and clang++ instead of gcc and g++, respectively.
	Add the flag -stdlib=libc++ to list of flags on lines 15 and 18.

Go back to your terminal (assuming it's still open) and type 'make'. If it's not open, reopen it and type
	cd path/to/the/code
	make

Your project should be now built! Congrats!


===BUILDING ON WINDOWS===
We highly recommend using Cygwin, as some parts of this program aren't fully functional without the POSIX APIs.

Instructions on how to build on Windows will be provided soon.


===CONFIGURATIONS===
Soundbench does have a few configurations that allow the user to disable one or more features in exchange for a removed dependency.

noRtAudio
Remove RtAudio. This will remove Soundbench's default audio backend, though a PortAudio backend will be available.

noPortAudio
Remove PortAudio. This will remove Soundbench's fallback audio backend, and if Soundbench is compiled without this or RtAudio, no real-time audio support will be enabled.

noPortMidi
Remove PortMidi. As of the 0.3.0 development branch, this will disable all real-time Midi input, as there is no alternative note input frontend.
