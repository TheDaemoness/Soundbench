NOTICE: This file is primarily for developers and people who want to be able to read Soundbench's presets with a hex editor.

All of Soundbench's presets are located in Soundbench's application data folder, whose location varies per system.
Windows:                    ~/AppData/Soundbench
Macintosh OS:               ~/Library/Soundbench
Linux and other *NIXes:     ~/.soundbench

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable Length Integer (VLI) Fields and Byte Arrays:
Variable length fields are similar to how they work in MIDI files.

The first bit indicates whether or not there is a following byte.
The remaining seven bits are used for the actual values.

The maximum length of a VLI field is capped at 8 bytes.

Byte Arrays work similarly except there is no cap and and each byte is suppsed to be treated as its own element.
These are generally used as strings of ASCII characters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type fields:
A type field is a 1-byte field that indicates the amount and type of data after it.

0x0: A byte.
0x1: A VLI field to be treated as a positive integer.
0x2: A VLI field to be treated as a negative integer.
0x3: A byte array.
0x4: A single-precision floating point number.
0x5: A floating point sample (like 0x3, except capped -1.0 to 1.0).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General format:
SoundbenchPreset <preset_version> <name> <artist> <description> <channels> <chan_arguments>

preset_version: A two-byte long integer storing the version of the preset to allow Soundbench to recognize older files.
name: A byte array storing the preset's name.
artist: A byte array sorting the artist's name.
description: A byte array sorting a short description of the preset.
channels: A multi-element field that indicates which generators and effects to load.
chan_arguments: An array of records that store arguments to the generators and channels to set their individual settings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channels section:

Format:
<generator1_type> <generator2_type> <generator3_type> <generator4_type> <effects1_array> <effects2_array> <effects3_array> <effects4_array>

generator#_type: A one-byte indicator of the type of generator.
effects#_array: A byte array that can be no longer than 4 elements storing the types of effects, in order.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel arguents section:

This is an array of argument fields (read: NOT A BYTE ARRAY). These will be passed via ctrl() to each Channel element.
The array does not store its own size, but is terminated by a special element.

Format:
<element> <setting> <type_field> <data>

element: A byte.
    The first nibble stores the number of the channel (1-4, NOT 0-3).
    The second nibble stores the element number (0 = generator, 1-4 = effects).

setting: A VLI field storing the number of the setting to be set.

type_field: A type field storing the type of the data to be read.

data: The "meat" of the preset.


This array is terminated when it reaches an incomplete argument field with an element value of 0.
