To build Soundbench, you have to make absolutely sure you have the following:
	A C++11 compliant compiler (we recommend g++ 4.6)
	libqt4
	libportaudio
	libpulseaudio (Optional as of 0.2.0)
	
If you have these, then all you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake
	make (or gmake)

Your executable will be in the same directory and will be named "Soundbench". Have fun!
