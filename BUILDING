To build Soundbench, you have to make absolutely sure you have the following:
	A C++11 compliant compiler (we recommend clang++)
	libqt4
	libportaudio
	libsndfile


===BUILDING ON *NIX===
All you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake
	make

Your executable will be in the same directory and will be named "Soundbench". Have fun!


===ON BUILDING WITH CLANG===
If you're going to build Soundbench with clang, then as at the time of writing qmake doesn't have a spec file for clang++, you will have to use few extra steps.

In addition to the above prerequisites, we recommend having LLVM's libc++, as clang++ doesn't play too nicely with libstdc++.

If g++ is your defualt C++ compiler, then open a terminal, and type the following
	cd path/to/the/code
	qmake

Then open the resulting Makefile in your favorite text-editing program, and do the following:
	Change lines 11, 12, and 17 to use clang and clang++ instead of gcc and g++, respectively.
	Add the flag -stdlib=libc++ to list of flags on lines 15 and 18.

Go back to your terminal (assuming it's still open) and type 'make'. If it's not open, reopen it and type
	cd path/to/the/code
	make

Your project should be now built! Congrats!


===BUILDING ON WINDOWS===
We highly recommend using Cygwin, as some parts of this program aren't fully functional without the POSIX APIs.

Instructions on how to build on Windows will be provided soon.
