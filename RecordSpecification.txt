NOTICE: This file is primarily for developers and people who want to be able to edit the presets record file on their own (which is disrecommended).

This is the specification that gives the format of the preset record file stored in the main directory of Soundbench's application data folder.

This is located in the root of Soundbench's application data folder, whose location varies per system.
Windows:                    ~/AppData/Soundbench
Macintosh OS:               ~/Library/Soundbench
Linux and other *NIXes:     ~/.soundbench

The main reason this file exists is to be able to quickly associate some simple metadata with preset files without having to read all the files.
This is not a binary file. Each record is newline-separated. Each field is tab-separated.

When Soundbench opens, it checks the presets directory to look for differences and updates this file as needed.
This process can also be forced manually with the "Refresh" button.

Record format:
<file_name> <name> <artist> <description> <tags>

file_name: The path to the file relative to the main presets directory.
name: The name of the preset stored in the file.
artist: The name of the artist stored in the file.
description: The description stored in the file.
tags: A space-separated list of tags that can be used to additionally filter information.
